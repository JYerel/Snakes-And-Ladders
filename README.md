# Snake-And-Ladders-ConsoleApp
A simple snaked and ladders game on a ConsoleApp. Total numbers of player that can play is assigined at prompt line.

**Rules:**
-When two players are playing, each rolls a dice, first to get a six, rolls first.
-PLayers can land on snakes and ladderss moving their tokens accordingly.
// ladder - move up from 2 to square 12
// ladder - move up from 20 square 30
// ladder - move up from 40 square 60
// ladder - move up from 40 square 60
// ladder - move up from 80 square 90
// snake - move down from 12 to square 2
// snake - move down from 15 to square 1
// snake - move down from 55 to square 45
// snake - move down from 75 to square 65
// snake - move down from 95 to square 85
-At point of reaching the goal mark (100), if players dice exceeds 100 mark then it stays at the same postion.
-When players dice hits 100, games ends with the winner announce.

**Improvements:**
Will be taking this logic and turn it to a WPF using XAML as my UI now that I have the Core Logic behind.
